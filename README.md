# birthdayApplication
# A C# Win Form Application (.NET Framework) that allows me to keep track of personal birthdays.
# I always have had problems keeping track of so individual birthdays and I thought it would be smart to solve this problem using C# .NET in order to prepare for upcoming interviews.
